<lyrics>
# Faith of our fathers! living still\\
in spite of dungeon, fire and sword.\\
O how our hearts beat high with joy,\\
whene'er we hear that glorious word:\\
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!\\
We will be true to thee till death.
# Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,\\
Were still in heart and conscience free;\\
How sweet would be their children's fate,\\
If they, like them, could die for thee!
# Faith of our fathers! Mary's prayers\\
Shall win our country back to thee;\\
And through the truth that comes from God,\\
England shall then indeed be free.
# Faith of our fathers! we will love\\
Both friend and foe in all our strife:\\
And preach thee, too, as love knows how,\\
By kindly deeds and virtuous life.

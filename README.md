Music notes for folksongs etc.

Latvian folksongs - the traditional musical folklore - has been widely available in the Internet already (cf. http://www.dainuskapis.lv/ ). But so far these have mostly contained the lyrics of these songs. Here we try to publish the melodies as well. Music is typeset using LilyPond - a free music markup standard. This site would contain *.ly files (music, including 1st stanza of lyrics); *.xml files (full lyrics and meta information) and also some files written in Scala that are necessary to process these songs. 

We also add booklets with songs to this project - they are PDF files under "books".

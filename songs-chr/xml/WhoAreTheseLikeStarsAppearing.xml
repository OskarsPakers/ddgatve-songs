# Who are these like stars appearing,\\
These, before God's throne who stand?\\
Each a golden crown is wearing;\\
Who are all this glorious band?\\
Alleluia! Hark, they sing,\\
Praising loud their heav'nly King.
# Who are these of dazzling brightness,\\
These in God's own truth arrayed,\\
Clad in robes of purest whiteness,\\
Robes whose luster ne'er shall fade,\\
Ne'er be touched by time's rude hand?\\
Whence comes all this glorious band?
# These are they who have contended\\
For their Saviour's honor long,\\
Wrestling on till life was ended,\\
Foll'wing not the sinful throng;\\
These, who well the fight sustained,\\
Triumph by the Lamb have gained.
# These are they whose hearts were riven,\\
Sore with woe and anguish tried,\\
Who in pray'r full oft have striven:\\
With the God they glorified:\\
Now, their painful conflict o'er,\\
God has bid them weep no more.
# These, like priests, have watched and waited,\\
Off'ring up to Christ their will,\\
Soul and body consecrated,\\
Day and night they serve him still.\\
Now in God's most holy place,\\
Blest they stand before his face.
